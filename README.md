Starting over with the AngularJS 1.X Codecademy Project

I am learning AngularJS 1.X and struggling with the Codecademy final Project. I had half of the app working, and then it broke when I added another part. 
I cannot make sense of the project as it is laid out, so I am starting over, and working through it as I watch video tutorials on the AngularJS website. 
If you have tips or helps, I'd love to chat.
